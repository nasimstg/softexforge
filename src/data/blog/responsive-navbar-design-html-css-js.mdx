Navigation bars are an essential component of every website, serving as a guide for users to navigate through the site and access its content. With the rise of mobile devices and different screen sizes, it's important to ensure that your website's navigation bar is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
In this article, we'll explore the best responsive navbar designs that can be created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether you're building a simple portfolio website or a complex e-commerce platform, these designs will help you create a navigation bar that is both functional and visually appealing.
# Here are some HTML CSS JS responsive navbars with example code:

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure fromHeading={1} toHeading={2} />
<br />

-  ## Fixed Top Navbar: 
   The fixed top navbar is one of the most common responsive navbar designs. It's a simple design that stays at the top of the screen, regardless of the user's scrolling. To create a fixed top navbar, you can use CSS position: fixed property, and set the top and left values to 0. This will ensure that the navbar stays at the top of the screen.
    
- ## Hamburger Menu Navbar: 
   The hamburger menu navbar is a popular responsive navbar design, especially for mobile devices. It uses a hamburger icon to hide and show the menu items, conserving space on the screen. To create a hamburger menu navbar, you can use JavaScript to toggle the visibility of the menu items, and CSS to style the menu and the hamburger icon.
    
- ## Sticky Navbar: 
    The sticky navbar is a design that remains fixed at the top of the screen when the user scrolls, but unlike the fixed top navbar, it only becomes fixed after the user has scrolled a certain distance. To create a sticky navbar, you can use JavaScript to detect the user's scroll position, and then use CSS position: fixed property to fix the navbar at the top of the screen.
    
- ##  Dropdown Navbar:
    The dropdown navbar is a design that shows a dropdown menu when a user hovers over a parent menu item. This design is perfect for websites with a large number of menu items, as it can conserve space on the screen and make the menu more organized. To create a dropdown navbar, you can use CSS to style the dropdown menu and JavaScript to show and hide the dropdown menu on hover.
    
- ##  Animated Navbar:
   The animated navbar is a design that uses animation to enhance the user experience. You can use CSS animations and transitions to create a smooth and elegant animation effect. To create an animated navbar, you can use JavaScript to detect the user's scroll position and then use CSS to animate the navbar.
