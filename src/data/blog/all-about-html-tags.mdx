## A simple html webpage

```html:index.html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>My Web Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
	    <h1>Welcome to my web page</h1>
	    <p>This is a simple web page created using HTML.</p>
	    <p>Here is a link to <a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a> website. </p>
	     <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
     </body>
     </html>
```

## What does HTML tag mean?

An HTML tag is a type of markup used to define the structure and layout of a web page. It consists of a name, usually surrounded by angle brackets, and sometimes additional attributes providing more information about the element.
For example, the `<p>` tag is used to create a paragraph element. When you want to create a paragraph in a web page, you use the opening `<p>` tag at the beginning of the paragraph and the closing `<p>` tag at the end of the paragraph. The text within the tags is the content of the paragraph.
`html <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p> `
Another example is the `<a>` tag used to create hyperlinks. The `<a>` tag has an attribute called href that indicates the URL of the linked page.
    ```html
    <a href="https://learnhowto.vercel.app">Learn anything with learnHowTo</a>
    ```
This will create a link called "Learn anything with learnHowTo" and when clicked, it will take the user to the "https://learnhowto.vercel.app" website.

In short, HTML tags are used to define the structure and layout of web pages and to indicate how different types of content should be displayed. They are the building blocks of HTML documents and are used to create the basic structure of web pages.

## Types of HTML tags:

There are different types of HTML tags, each with a specific purpose and function. Some of the main types of HTML tags include:

- **Structural Tags:** These tags are used to create the basic structure of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs and lists. Examples include `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ol>` and `<ul>`.
- **Semantic Tags:** These tags are used to describe the meaning and structure of a web page's content. Examples include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<time>` and `<mark>`.
- **Link Tags:** These tags are used to create links to other web pages or specific locations on the same web page. Examples include `<a>` and `<link>`.
- **Media Tags:** These tags are used to add various types of media such as images, videos and audio to a web page. Examples include `<img>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, and `<source>`.
- **Form Tags:** These tags are used to create forms for user input. Examples include `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, `<label>`, and `<button>`.
- **Meta Tags:** These tags provide metadata about the web page, such as keywords, descriptions and character encodings. Examples include `<meta>`, `<base>` .
- **Obsolete tags:** These are tags that were used in previous versions of HTML but are no longer recommended for use. Examples include `<font>`, `<center>`, `<strike>`.

## Overall, HTML tags can be divided into 3 main categories:

- **Containers** , which contain other elements and are used to group them.
- **Content tags** , which are used to define the actual content.
- **Meta tags** , which are used to provide additional information about the document.
