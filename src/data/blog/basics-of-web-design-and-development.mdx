# Basic information about web design and development:

## First of all what is a website?

A website is a collection of related web pages, images, videos, and other multimedia content accessible through a web browser over the Internet. Websites are created and maintained by individuals, organizations and companies to share information, provide services or sell products. Websites can be simple, with just a few pages, or complex, with many pages and interactive features. The main elements of a website include layout, design, text and multimedia content, as well as defining how the website functions. Websites are hosted on web servers, which are computers that are connected to the Internet and store the files that make up the website, allowing users to access it from anywhere in the world.
## Second, what is web design and development?

Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites. It involves a combination of skills like programming languages (eg: HTML, CSS, JavaScript), design and problem solving. Web developers use these skills to create and implement the technical aspects of a website, while also ensuring that the website is accessible, user-friendly, and visually appealing. There are different types of web development, including front-end development (which focuses on the user-facing aspects of a website), back-end development (which focuses on server-side logic and databases), and full-stack development. (which includes both front-end and back-end development).
## Thirdly what is HTML CSS JS?

### HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create the structure and layout of a web page. It is used to define the different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more, and how they are organized and displayed. HTML code is interpreted by the web browser, which displays the web page to the user.
HTML code consists of a series of elements, represented by tags. These tags are used to indicate different parts of a web page and define their features and characteristics. For example, the `<p>` tag is used to create a paragraph, while the `<img>` tag is used to insert an image. HTML uses opening and closing tags to define the beginning and end of an element.

HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, which introduces new features like semantic tags, multimedia support and form validation to make it more powerful and easier to use.

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language, usually HTML. It is used to define the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a web page, separate from the HTML code that defines the page's structure and content.

CSS code is applied to the elements of an HTML document and allows developers to control the layout and design of a website in a centralized and efficient way. With CSS, developers can change the look and feel of a website by changing a single file instead of editing the code of each individual web page.

CSS uses a set of selectors, which are used to target specific HTML elements, and a set of properties and values that define the presentation of those elements. For example, the 'color' attribute can be used to change the text color of an element and the 'background-color' can be used to change the background color of an element.
CSS allows the use of media queries, which allow specific CSS styles to be applied based on device characteristics or the user's screen size, making it responsive.

CSS3 is the latest version of CSS, which introduces new features such as animations, transitions and responsive design, making it more powerful and flexible.

### JS

JavaScript (JS) is a programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic features on websites. It is a client-side language, meaning it is executed by the web browser on the user's device rather than by the server. This allows for a more responsive and interactive experience for the user, as the code can run and make changes to the web page without the need to load a new page from the server.

JavaScript is used to create a wide range of interactive elements on a website, such as forms, image sliders and pop-ups, as well as to create complex web applications such as online stores, social media platforms and games. It can also be used to control the behavior of a web page, such as validating user input, creating cookies, or the Document Object Model (DOM) which is the structure of a website, allowing developers to change the structure and layout. of the website

JavaScript can be used with HTML and CSS and is a fundamental component of modern web development, as it enables interactive and dynamic features in websites and web applications.
