An HTML editor is a software application that allows users to create and edit HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) code. HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages and is the backbone of the World Wide Web. There are many different types of HTML editors available, ranging from simple text editors with basic syntax highlighting to advanced integrated development environments (IDEs) with advanced features like code auto-completion and debugging. The choice of HTML editor will depend on the user's level of experience, the type of projects they are working on, and their personal preferences.
